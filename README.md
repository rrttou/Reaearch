Abstract
  Designing an automated agent for Human-Agent Negotiation is a challenging task. Especially in the domain that combines multi-issue bilateral negotiations   and repeated negotiations. In this domain, the agents negotiate with humans over more than one item, and there are several rounds of negotiation in each   game.
  Designing this kind of agent can be very challenging. Our agent needs to estimate the preferences of the human opponent in real-time, proposing fair       offers that will be excepted by the human opponent but taking into account, not proposing offers that don’t increase the agent’s score.
  On the other hand, local search algorithms have proven to be effective in a variety of fields in artificial intelligence.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach for an automated agent for this type of negotiation by using local search algorithms, in particular: Simulated   Annealing and Hill Climbing.
  As we analyze the results from our experiments and compare the local search algorithms, we show that local search algorithms can be more efficient in  
  Human-Agent negotiation than traditional methods. Moreover, our agent is capable of negotiating efficiently and outperforming the human opponent.
